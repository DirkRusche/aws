## Regions

![AWS Regions worldwide](images/regions_worldwide.png)

![AWS Regions EMEA](images/regions_emea.png)

- Global Infrastructure
- Region = Location
- Region consists of multiple AZs (**A**vailability **Z**ones)
- Near us (Germany): 
  
  Code | Name | Country | Since
  --- | --- | :---: | :---:
  `eu-central-1` | Frankfurt | Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª | 2014
  `eu-west-1` | Ireland | Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª | 2007
  `eu-west-2` | London | UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ | 2016
  `eu-west-3` | Paris | France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· | 2017
  `eu-south-1` | Milan | Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ | 2020
  `eu-north-1` | Stockholm | Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª | 2018
  `eu-east-1` | ? | Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ | Upcoming (2022/2023)

- AZs are physically separated from each other
  - Connected via low latency links
  - Marked by a letter behind region code
    - eg.: `eu-central-1[a,b,c]`
    - Warning: `eu-central-1a` is not an unique identifier (depends on the account) [read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html)
  - Traffic within one AZ is free (rule of thumb)

## S3 (Simple Storage Service) ![S3 Icon](aws_icons/s3.png)

- Cloud block storage
- Arbitrary number of files, each up to 5TB per file
- `99.999999999%` (11 9s) durability (= 10 million objects saved over 10,000 years -> expectation: 1 is lost)
- Different storage classes
  - `Standard` - Low latency and high throughput
  - `Intelligent Tiering` - Automatically optimizes storage costs (dependencing on access pattern)
  - `Standard-IA` (IA = Infrequent-Access) - Same as Standard but less availability 
  - `One Zone-IA` - Only one AZ -> less availability
  - `Glacier` - Very cheap; retrieval time at least a few minutes
  - `Glacier Deep Archive` - cheapest option, at least 12 hours retrievel time
  - Dictates the [price](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)
    - Standard = `$0.0245/GB`
    - Glacier Deep Archive = `$0.0018/GB` (92,65% less)
- S3 only knows of keys, eg. when you store `path/to/a/file` this (=`path/to/a/file`) is also the key, but the S3 management UI shows `path`, `to` and `a` as a directory
- Versioning, Encryption, Lifecycle Management, Events

## SQS (Simple Queue Service) ![SQS Icon](aws_icons/sqs.png)

- Decouples systems, messages have to be pulled
- Two types
  - `Standard`: 3,000 messages / sec, at least once (occasionally more than one time), best effort ordering
  - `FiFo`: 300 messages / sec, exactly once, **f**irst **i**n **f**irst **o**ut
- Visibility timeout while processing (after message pull)
- Batching of messages possible, max payload `256KB`
- Max. message retention 14 days
- DLQ (**d**ead **l**etter **q**ueue): unprocessable messages are automatically moved

## SNS (Simple Notification Service) ![SNS Icon](aws_icons/sns.png)

- Pub / Sub (Topics)
- Standard, FiFo
- Filtering, Fanout
- Push to
  - Lambda
  - SQS
  - Kinesis
  - HTTP
  - Email
  - SMS
- In comparison to SQS this is push (whereas SQS is pull)

## Kinesis (Data Streams) ![Kinesis Icon](aws_icons/kinesis.png)

- Kinesis Video Streams, **Kinesis Data Streams**, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics
- Real time (within 70ms)
- Multiple producer, multiple consumer
- Shard is base throughput unit (`1MB/s` write, `2MB/s` read)
- Every event has a partition key (is used for routing onto a shard; usually user ID)

## RDS (Relational Database Service) ![RDS Icon](aws_icons/rds.png)

- Different engines available
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - PostgreSQL
  - Aurora
    - MySQL or PostgreSQL **compatible** (it's a fork)
    - Serverless (â€˜can sleepâ€™), automatic scaling
- Read replicas (performance)
- Multi-AZ deployments (availability, durability)
- Automated backups, snapshots
- Maintenance window (applying backups and stuff, downtime possible)

## [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) ![DynamoDB Icon](aws_icons/dynamodb.png)

**TODO**

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) ![EC2 Icon](aws_icons/ec2.png)

- Many AMI (**A**mazon **M**achine **I**mage) available
- Different Instance types
  - General Purposes
  - Compute Optimized
  - Memory Optimized
  - Accelerated Computing (GPU)
  - Storage Optimized
  - [Nice EC2 instance type overview](https://instances.vantage.sh/) (former ec2instances.info)
  - Max is `U-24TB1 Metal`: `448` vCPU, `24576GB` RAM
- Storage options
  - Instance Storage - fastest
  - EBS (Elastic Block Storage) - can only be attached to one instance
  - EFS (Elastic File System) - can be shared by multiple instances
- Hibernation
- Spot Instances, Saving Plans, Reserved Instances

## ASG ![EC2 ASG Icon](aws_icons/ec2_asg.png)

**TODO**

## ECS (Elastic Container Service) ![ECS Icon](aws_icons/ecs.png)

- Can run on EC2 or Fargate (serverless)
- ECS consists of clusters
  - Cluster contains Services
  - Service contains Tasks (=Instances) (Kubernetes: Pod)
  - Task contains Containers
- Deployment ensures availability (you can set a minimum of healthy tasks in percent)
- Failed tasks are automatically replaced
